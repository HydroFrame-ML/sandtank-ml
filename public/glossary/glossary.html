<dl>
  <dt>Epoch:</dt>
  <dd>
    One complete round of training and validation for a machine learning model.
    You can think of this as one training cycle.
  </dd>

  <dt>L1:</dt>
  <dd>
    This is one of the ways in which the accuracy of an ML model is calculated
    and refers to the sum of all the differences between the AI and simulation
    outputs. This can also be thought of as the total error measured (also known
    as total loss measured).
  </dd>

  <dt>Loss:</dt>
  <dd>
    A number indicating how bad the ML model’s prediction was. If the prediction
    is perfect, loss will be 0. The higher the loss, the greater the error.
  </dd>

  <dt>LMax:</dt>
  <dd>
    This is one way the accuracy of an ML model is calculated. It is the largest
    difference between what the AI predicted and the simulation output.
  </dd>

  <dt>Permeability:</dt>
  <dd>
    Permeability refers to the capacity of a geologic material (rock, gravel,
    sand, clay, etc.) to transmit fluids; the permeability of a material is
    mainly controlled by the size of pore spaces and how interconnected they
    are. High permeability material allows water/fluid to move through more
    easily than low permeability material. In the ParFlow Sandtank, there are a
    range of permeability values that go from low permeability material, like
    clay, to high permeability material, like gravel.
  </dd>

  <dt>Machine Learning:</dt>
  <dd>
    A type of artificial intelligence where computer systems learn and adapt
    without the benefit of explicit instructions. Instead they draw on
    algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from
    patterns in data. The type of machine learning model utilized by Sandtank-ML
    is a neural network.
  </dd>

  <dt>Machine Learning Output:</dt>
  <dd>
    The prediction of saturation or pressure generated by the machine learning
    model based on the parameters, training set, and other variables selected.
  </dd>

  <dt>Neural Network:</dt>
  <dd>
    A computational learning system that uses a network of functions to
    understand and analyze data and produce an output. In neural networks, the
    ML system learns by processing large known datasets. This means that the
    datasets are labeled with the ‘correct’ answers. This enables the network to
    learn what characteristics of the input are needed to produce the correct
    output. Once a neural network has trained on enough known datasets, it can
    begin processing unknown datasets and return accurate results.
  </dd>

  <dt>Physically Based Simulation:</dt>
  <dd>
    A physically based simulation incorporates characteristics or properties of
    the systems they wish to model, which allows them to predict the behavior of
    that system when given specific inputs. In the physically based simulation
    step, we use a hydrology model that incorporates equations for: groundwater
    flow, or the movement of water underground; overland flow, the movement of
    water over the surface; and plant processes, like evapotranspiration. These
    equations allow us to simulate, or predict, how water will behave in our
    system.
  </dd>

  <dt>Physically Based Simulation Output:</dt>
  <dd>
    The prediction of saturation or pressure generated by the physically based
    simulation based on the parameters provided and the physical characteristics
    of the model area.

    Based on the inherent permeability of the materials and the user-defined
    boundary conditions, ParFlow will simulate an output. Output files are
    pressure and saturation, which the user can visualize separately. The
    pressure output (purple) shows how much pressure is present in each location
    in the model. Darker purple means greater pressure and lighter purple means
    lower pressure. The saturation output (blue) displays presence or absence of
    saturation; blue is saturation and white is unsaturated. Pressure:
  </dt>

  <dt>Saturation:</dt>
  <dd>
    Saturation refers to the amount of water in a geologic material. When all of
    the pore spaces and spaces between particles are filled with water, then a
    material is saturated. If there is a mix of water and air in those same
    spaces, then the material is unsaturated.
  </dd>

  <dt>Standard Deviation:</dt>
  <dd>
    Standard deviation is a common statistical term that refers to the measure
    of how spread out a set of numbers are. A low standard deviation means that
    most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value; a high standard
    deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range. In this
    case, the standard deviation is referring to the difference between the ML
    output and the simulation.
  </dd>


  <dt>Training:</dt>
  <dd>
    The process of optimizing your ML model by feeding it datasets to learn
    from.
  </dd>

  <dt>Training Set:</dt>
  <dd>
    The dataset you use to train your machine learning model. In Sandtank-ML,
    you get to choose between 3 different datasets: wet, dry, and all. The wet
    choice represents wet conditions (higher values), the dry choice represents
    dry conditions (low values), and the all choice includes both wet and dry
    datasets. Pay attention to how your choice impacts the accuracy of your
    model and if this changes depending on the initial conditions for the
    physically based simulation.
  </dd>

  <dt>Validation:</dt>
  <dd>
    the process where a trained model is evaluated with a testing data set.
    Through the process of validation, the places where the ML model is
    performing well and where there are high rates of errors are identified so
    that it can learn and improve through additional rounds of training and
    validation.
